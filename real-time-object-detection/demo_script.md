30–45s Demo Script:

0–5s: "This is a real-time object detection & alert system built with YOLOv8 and Streamlit."

5–15s: "I choose the YOLO nano model for speed. In the sidebar I configured an ROI and set 'person' as the alert label."

15–35s: Walk into the ROI — pause while the app shows bounding box and ALERT. "You can see it logged the event and saved a snapshot."

35–45s: "All events are persisted to logs/events.csv and snapshots to logs/snapshots. This integrates easily with webhooks, SMS, or edge devices."
